# Pleroma

> Pleroma is a free, federated social networking server built on open protocols. It is compatible with GNU Social, Mastodon, and many other ActivityPub and OStatus implementations.

## Access

Public. See details below how to get access.

## Details

Come to do shitpost about ponies with us at [Ministry of Moonbutt Science](https://ministry.moonbutt.Science)! You'll be asked for easy Kocaptcha and email verification during registation.

## Paranoid corner

You [should](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html) use Pleroma because it's [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) which respects your freedom. In opposite of that, Twitter is a [proprietary](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html) site which is spying on you.

Pleroma is a part of a huge decentralized network where everyone can be an operator
of server and dictate own rules (or their absence). Twitter is centralized site and
can be shutted down completely, they can and do censor people and their messages.

## Known issues

- Push notifications won't work in local frontends
- Third party web clients won't login when you are logged-in
  - Could be fixed by clearing the site data
- Proxyfied attachments and avatars can be blank for some time
