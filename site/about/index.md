# About our server

Currently our “infrastructure” consists of two servers (except of [Vault](/how/peertube.md))
with codenames: *Trixie* and *Derpy*. Both are VPS hosted on Hetzner and cost 5
euro monthly with pretty low specs.

*Trixie* is the main server which powers our [Matrix](/how/matrix.md), [Gitea](/how/gitea.md),
[Pleroma](/how/pleroma.md), and [Plume](/how/plume.md) instances.

*Derpy* is the mail server which powers our instance of [Mailu email stack](/how/email.md).

To be honest, VPS is a bad option for self-hosting: it's expensive in the long run
and gives you zero control over your data. Well, we would say it's even not zero
— it's negative value, because you agree to follow provider's ToS and laws of
their country.

It's slow. It's unstable. It's not suitable for mass using. And because of that…

## “Crowdfunding” for real hardware

Yep, we've decided to switch to real hardware. And here our plans:

- ODROID-H2 motherboard ($100)
- a case for ODROID-H2 ($15)
- 32 gigabytes of RAM ($200)
- a terabyte NVMe SSD ($200)
- a Mikrotik router with a gigabit LAN ($150)
- monthly plan for the gigabit Internet ($20)

In total **~$700**. We have **$0**.

After purchasing of this cuteness we could guarantee relative stability.

This is not a “crowdfunding” campaign in usual sense. There is no time limit, no
progress bar, no refunds. This is just a list of [Coma](/who/commagray.md)'s
future purchases which he gonna to buy regardless of financial condition of
Inner Equestria. But you can speed up this process with your donations.
