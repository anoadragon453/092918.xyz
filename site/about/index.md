# About us

**Inner Equestria** is a nonprofit project founded by [“My Little Pony“ fans](/who/#staff).

We follow the same goals as [PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io),
[Framasoft](https://framasoft.org), and many other organizations: we cover 
[issues of the modern network](http://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html)
and provide access to more ethical alternatives — [free as freedom software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

You can use programs on our server absolutely free of charge: we have [email](/how/email.md), [a chat](/how/matrix.md), [a video hosting](/how/peertube.md), systems for [blogs](/how/plume.md) and [microblogs](/how/pleroma.md), [proxy](/how/shadowsocks.md) (including [for Telegram](/how/mtproxy.md)), [a Git hosting](/how/gitea.md), and even [an imageboard](/how/lynxchan.md).

However, you can [support us](/donate/) in any time.

The first one is a VPS hosted on Cockbox and costs 10 dollars monthly, the second one is a VPS hosted on Hetzner and costs 5 euros monthly, and the third one is a bare metal server hosted at [Coma's](/who/commagray.md) homeland.
