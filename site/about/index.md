# About our server

Currently our “infrastructure” consists of two servers (except of [Vault](/how/peertube.md))
with codenames: Trixie and Derpy. Both are VPS hosted on Hetzner on 2.5 euro
monthly plan with 1 vCPU and 2 gigabytes of RAM.

Trixie is the main server which powers our Matrix, Gitea, Pleroma, and Plume instances.

Derpy is the mail server which powers our instance of Mailu email stack.

To be honest, VPS is a bad option for self-hosting: it's expensive in the long run
and gives you zero control over your data. Well, we would say it's even not zero
— it's negative value, because you agree to follow provider's ToS and laws of
their country.

It's slow. It's unstable. It's not suitable for mass using. And because of that…

## Crowdfunding for real hardware

Yep, we've decided to switch to real hardware. And here our plans:

- ODROID-H2 motherboard ($100)
- a case for ODROID-H2 ($15)
- 32 gigabytes of RAM ($200)
- a terabyte of NVMe SSD ($200)
- a Mikrotik router with a gigabit LAN ($150)
- monthly plan for a gigabit Internet ($20)

In total **~$700**. We have **$0**.
